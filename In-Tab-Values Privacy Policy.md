ITV is a paid service that doesn't help third parties to advertise their products to you. We also do not collect or sell any of your information.

## Information collection and use
ITV does not collect or store any of your personal information or Roblox cookies. Though ITV does not read your authentication cookies, by using the extension you are giving ITV permission to make authenticated requests from Roblox.com on your behalf.

If you join our community Discord server, you give us permission to communicate with you about your use of our software, and/or services, product announcements, and software updates, as well as respond to your requests for assistance, including providing account verification support if you're having difficulty accessing your account.

## Does ITV review user content?
Private user information / content is never reviewed, but any public messages or communications made in our Discord server may be moderated / reviewed by our staff.

While ITV does store settings in extension storage, we do not use cookies for storing information or for the purposes of advertising our product or any other product to you. We do not use or store third party cookies such as Roblox cookies or Google Analytics cookies.

## Does ITV collect information from children?
ITV does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. ITV the extension does not collect any data from it's users. However, messages and communications made in our Discord server may be moderated / reviewed by our staff. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any personal information through our Discord server. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide personal information through our server. If we determine we have collected personal information from a child younger than 13 years of age, we will take reasonable measures to remove that information from our server.

## How secure is my information?
ITV is committed to protecting the security of your information and takes reasonable precautions to protect it. However, internet data transmissions, whether wired or wireless, cannot be guaranteed to be completely secure, and because of this, we cannot ensure the security of information handled by ITV, including personal data and user content; accordingly, you acknowledge that you do so at your own risk.

## Will this privacy policy ever change?
As ITV evolves, we may need to update this policy to keep pace with changes in our software, services, our business, and laws applicable to us and you. We will, however, always maintain our commitment to respect your privacy. We will notify you of any material changes that impact your rights under this policy through our Discord server. We recommend that you periodically check back here to stay informed of any changes. Please note that your continued use of ITV after any change means that you agree with and consent to be bound by the new policy. If you disagree with any changes in this policy and do not wish your information to be subject to it, you will need to stop use of our services.
